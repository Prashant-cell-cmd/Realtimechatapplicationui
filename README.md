💬 Real-Time Chat Application using C++

Live Project | Socket Programming | Client–Server Architecture

📌 Project Overview

This project is a Real-Time Chat Application developed using C++ socket programming, implementing a client–server communication model.
It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and exchange messages in real time over a network.

To enhance usability and presentation, the application UI is designed using Figma, providing an interactive and modern chat interface similar to real-world messaging platforms.

This project demonstrates core computer science concepts such as networking, multithreading, inter-process communication, and system-level programming, making it a strong live project for academic and interview purposes.

🎯 Objectives

Implement real-time communication using TCP/IP sockets

Understand client–server architecture

Handle multiple clients simultaneously using multithreading

Simulate a real-world chat system

Design an interactive and professional UI using Figma

Build a project suitable for viva, GitHub, and placements

🧠 Why This Is a LIVE Project

Uses actual network communication

Supports multiple clients at the same time

Messages are delivered instantly

Can be demonstrated live during evaluation

Based on real-world messaging system principles
